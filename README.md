## 🎯 What is this?

Everyone follows whale traders blindly. Nobody asks: "Is this whale actually skilled, or just lucky?"

PolyReceipts is a **whale accountability tool** that analyzes Polymarket traders and answers this question with rigorous statistics:

- **Brier Score** — How accurate are their predictions?
- **Calibration Curve** — Does their confidence match reality?
- **Statistical Significance** — Can we rule out luck?
- **ROI & P&L** — What's their actual edge?

## 🚨 Key Insight

That whale with $10M in profits? They might need **500+ more predictions** before we can distinguish their skill from variance at p<0.05.

## 🐋 Featured Whales

- **🐳 Théo** — $85M profit, politics specialist
- **🐋 swisstony** — Sports betting focus
- **🦈 Domer** — NFL and NBA
- **🚨 CRYINGLITTLEBABY** — EXPOSED: 45% win rate, profits from latency arbitrage, NOT prediction skill
- **🌍 LeJoe** — Geopolitics specialist
- **📈 jacobjhu** — Crypto volatility trader

3. **The Receipts** — Every bet, every outcome, no hiding
4. **Category Breakdown** — Are they good at politics or just sports?
5. **P&L Timeline** — One lucky trade or consistent edge?

## 🔬 Methodology

### Brier Score
Measures prediction accuracy. Lower is better:
- 0.00 = Perfect predictions
- 0.25 = Random guessing
- <0.20 = Better than average

### Calibration
When a trader bets at 70% confidence, do they win 70% of the time?
Perfect calibration = predictions match outcomes.

### Statistical Significance
Uses Wilson score confidence intervals to determine if an edge is real or just variance.
