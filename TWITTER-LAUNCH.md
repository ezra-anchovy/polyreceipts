# PolyReceipts Twitter Launch Plan

## Timing
**Super Bowl Week (Feb 3-9, 2026)** — Perfect timing:
- NY AG warning = regulatory attention on prediction markets
- Polymarket vs Kalshi volume war = billions being traded
- Sports betting = mainstream attention

## Launch Thread Draft

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
That Polymarket whale with $2M in positions?

We ran the numbers.

45% win rate. Pure luck.

Here are the receipts 🧾

polyreceipts.com
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
The prediction market space has a credibility problem:

• Influencers claim 70%+ win rates
• Whales get followed blindly
• No one checks the actual results

Until now.
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
PolyReceipts analyzes any Polymarket wallet:

📊 Real win rate vs claimed
📈 Calibration (are they overconfident?)
🔍 Recent streak
🏆 Biggest wins/losses
🧮 Brier score (skill vs luck)

Enter any wallet address. See the truth.
```

### Tweet 4 (Example)
```
Example: CRYINGLITTLEBABY

• Claims: Skilled predictor
• Reality: 45% win rate, -9.3% ROI
• Verdict: ARBITRAGEUR (latency exploit)

The $381K profit? Not from predictions.
From front-running.
