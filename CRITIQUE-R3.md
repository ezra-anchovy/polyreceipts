## Analysis by Criterion

### 1. Value Prop Clarity: 7/10 (+4)
- **Evaluation**: Value proposition is clearer than before. The "show THEIR receipts" angle is emerging.
- **Remaining gap**: Could still emphasize specific benefits more directly through punchy language.

### 2. Visual Hierarchy: 8/10 (+3)
- **Evaluation**: Good use of color and spacing. Eye flows naturally.
- **Remaining gap**: Some elements still compete for attention. Consider simplifying further.

### 3. Data Credibility: 7/10 (+3)
- **Evaluation**: Clearer data presentation building trust.
- **Remaining gap**: Adding authoritative sources or testimonials could strengthen further.

### 4. Mobile Experience: 6/10 (unchanged)
- **Evaluation**: Functional but not optimized.
- **Blockers**: Navigation and readability need work on small screens.
- **This is now a P0** - can't launch without decent mobile.

### 5. Call to Action: 5/10 (+2)
- **Evaluation**: CTA improved but lacks prominence vs other elements.
- **Blockers**: Strategic placement and visual emphasis needed.
- **This is now a P0** - share button MUST be impossible to miss for Twitter launch.

## Overall Analysis

**Sales Potential**: Improved but not there yet. Focus on:
1. **CTA prominence** - Make share button bigger/brighter, more central
2. **Mobile polish** - This week is Super Bowl, mobile traffic will be high
3. **Immediate hook** - First 3 seconds must grab attention

**Ready for Twitter launch?** Not quite. P0s remaining:
- [ ] Share button more prominent (brighter, central position)
- [ ] Mobile view polished
- [ ] Hero text tightened for immediate impact

## R4 Focus Areas
1. **CTA overhaul** - Double the share button size, high-contrast color
2. **Mobile first pass** - Test on actual phone, fix what's broken
3. **Hero punch** - Every word must earn its place
